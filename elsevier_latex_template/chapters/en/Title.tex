\title{The algorithm of automatic gain quadrature signal module's working\tnoteref{titlenote}}
\tnotetext[titlenote]{This article is a start for development IP- module of automatic gain quadrature signal, namely, the device, resulting in an average level is an arbitrary signal to the desired at a predetermined time interval. The device is intended for using in Vivado package and is focused on the implementation on the basis of FPGA logic programming company Xilinx family - 7.}
